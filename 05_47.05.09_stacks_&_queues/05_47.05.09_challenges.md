# Challenges

## Brower Back/Forward
Design how you could design a browser back/forward system using two stacks, so that you can visit a series of sites (Google, Yahoo, EBay, go back to Yahoo, then forward again to EBay, then onto Apple, and so on).
Write pseudo-code for this.

Instead of using the asked "two stacks" to keep track of a series of visited sites, I will use a single data structure prototyped on a doubly-linked list, `DoublyLinkedList` that is in turn based on my `DoublyLinkedListPrototype` class I have submitted as part of the "further study" for this assignment.
- Use a doubly-linked list to prototype a class called `BrowserStack`. The doubly-linked list will a new property called `currentNode`, and have the methods `returnCurrentNode()`, `returnPreviousNode()` and `returnNextNode()` developed
```js
class DoublyLinkedList extends DoublyLinkedListPrototype{

	constructor(){
		super();
		this.currentNode = /*...*/;
	}

	returnCurrentNode(){
		return this.currentNode();
	}

	returnPreviousNode(){

		const beforeCurrentNode = this.currentNode.previous;

		if(beforeCurrentNode)
			return beforeCurrentNode;
		
		return /*something if this is headNode or empty list*/

	}

	returnNextNode(){

		const afterCurrentNode = this.currentNode.previous;

		if(afterCurrentNode)
			return afterCurrentNode;
		
		return /*something if this is tailNode or empty list*/


	}

	//	...

}

class BrowserStack extends DoublyLinkedList{

	constructor(){

		super();
		//	...

	}

	// ...
	back(){
		this.returnPreviousNode();
	}

	forward(){
		this.returnNextNode();
	}

	//	maybe a return history stack?

}
```

## String Reversal
Write a function that reverses a string by handling one letter at a time. You cannot use an arrays, nor can you use any string-reversal built-in method.
```js
//	pseudocode because I really don't want to (this is extra):
//	1. dump the string into a stack.
//	2. pop the stack for each letter and concat to a string.
```

Here is my array method, for fun:
```js
function reverseString(inputString){

	const stringLength = inputString.length;
	let stringArray = new Array(inputString.length);
	
	for(let i=0; i<=stringLength-i; i++){
		// handles the index for an odd string length

		const indexComplement = stringLength - i - 1;

		stringArray[i] = inputString.charAt(indexComplement);
		stringArray[indexComplement] = inputString.charAt(i);

	}

	return ''.join(stringArray);

}
```

## Balanced Brackets
Write a function that is passed a string which can contain any text, including different kinds of brackets: `{}`, `[]`, `()`.

It should examine the string and decide if the string is "balanced" --a balanced string is one where the different kinds of brackets are properly balanced, such that you never close an bracket that isn't opened, is out of order, or end up with unclosed brackets.

Examples of balanced strings:
- `hello (no brackets)`
- `(hi) [there]`
- `(hi [there])`
- `(((hi)))`
Imbalanced:
- `(hello (bracket left open at end)`
- `(nope] (wrong type closed)`
- `((ok) [nope)] (closed out of order)`

```js
//function determineBalanced(inputString){

	// halfway realization: nope because theoretically, I could "consume" 1 of the character with a sufficient combination of the other(s)
	/* idea: when a `{` is encountered, add 1; `[`, 10; `(`, 100
		when the conjugate closing is encountered subtract the respective
	*/

	// const characterValues = {

	// 	'{': 1,
	// 	'}': -1,
	// 	'[': 10,
	// 	']': -10,
	// 	'(': 100,
	// 	')': -100

	// }

	// function _determineBalancedHelperOddString(index = 0){

	// 	if(index === inputString.length)
	// 		return 0;

	// 	return (characterValues[inputString.charAt(index)] === undefined ? 0 : characterValues[inputString.charAt(index)]) + _determineBalancedHelperOddString(index + 1);
	// 		// thanks to Borislav Hadzhiev (https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-convert-undefined-to-zero#convert-undefined-to-0-using-javascript) for showing how to return undefined as 0

	// }

	// return _determineBalancedHelperOddString === 0;

	// handling out of order maybe: expect the next symbol to be something and not popping the pseudo-ll struc if it is the wrong symbol
//}
class BalancedStringStack extends Stack {

	constructor(){
			
		super();

		this.characterValueMap = {
			'{': 1,
			'}': -1,
			'[': 2,
			']': -2,
			'(': 3,
			')': -3
		}
			
	}

	push(value){
		// only called for positive values

		unshift(this.characterValueMap[value]);
			
	}

		// check if the passed character is the complement of the next one in the stack. if it is, pop from the stack and return undefined (falsy value)
		// else return a string (truthy value)
		attemptToPop(value){
			// only called for negative values
			
		if(this.peek() + this.characterValueMap[value] === 0){
			pop();			
			return;
		}else{
			// understand what error, most likely out of order...
			return 'make this more detailed with cases';
		}

	}

}

function determineBalanced(inputString){
	
	const balancedStringTracker = new BalancedStringStack();
	const characterMapping = balancedStringTracker.characterValueMap;

	let peekErrorFlag = false;
	let stringIndex = 0;

	while(!peekErrorFlag && stringIndex < inputString.length){

		const currentCharacter = inputString.charAt(stringIndex);

		if(characterMapping[currentCharacter] < 0){
			peekErrorFlag = balancedStringTracker.attemptToPop(currentCharacter);
		}else if(characterMapping[currentCharacter] > 0){
			balancedStringTracker.push(currentCharacter)
		}

		stringIndex++;

	}

	return peekErrorFlag || balancedStringTracker.isEmpty();	// if it is balanced, the stack should be empty; if truthy probably unclosed.
	
}
```

## Josephus Survivor
This is a classic algorithm problem, based on a Biblical-era tale.

Imagine a group of 10 people in a circle, numbered 1 to 10. If we started at the first person (#1) and killed every three people, it would look like this:
```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
      !        !        !
```
This continues, though, looping around again, starting with where we left of at #10 (we’ll mark the freshly-removed as red/! and the previously-removed in striked-out gray/X):
```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
   !  X        X  !     X
```

And again, starting where that left off, at #8, and continuing:

```
1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
!  X  X        X  X  !  X

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
X  X  X     !  X  X  X  X

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
X  X  X     X  X  X  X  X  !
```
At this point, only #4 remains, so that person would be our “survivor”.

Write an algorithm that, given a number of people, and the “skip”, which person will be the survivor.

For example:

find_survivor(10, 3) // 4
There are different ways you can solve this, but a good solution uses one of the structures covered in this exercise.

```js
// Brute force way: Linked List because removing nodes is O(1).
```

## Calculator (Polskie Notation)
In this exercise, you’ll build a “polish notation calculator”.

Polish notation is a different way to write an artithmetic expression. For example, instead of writing 1 + 2 * 3, as we would in normal (“infix”) style, we could write it with the operators to the left of their arguments. This expression would become + 1 * 2 3. You can read a polish notation expression backwards to see exactly what it does — in this case, multiply 2 times 3, and add that result to 1.

Let’s try this out:
```
calc("+ 1 2")  # 1 + 2 == 3

calc("* 2 + 1 2")  # 2 * (1 + 2) == 6

calc("+ 9 * 2 3")   # 9 + (2 * 3) == 15
```

Let’s make sure we have non-commutative operators (subtraction and division) working:
```
calc("- 1 2")  # 1 - 2 == -1

calc("- 9 * 2 3")  # 9 - (2 * 3) == 3

calc("/ 6 - 4 2")  # 6 / (4 - 2) == 3
```

```js
// two 'temp solution' variables, two number variables, one operator variable; all init. to null
// brute force way: I have to read backwards; therefore, pop each element, if it is a number, store it to one of two `number` variables, both initialized as null; if it is a symbol store it to `operator` variable, initialize as null
// once both number variables are not null and operator variable is not null, perform the operation, placing the first filled number variable ahead; store the result into a `temp` solution variable. reset number variables and oeprator variable to `null`
// read the next two; if it is a variable and operator, perform the operation on the "temp solution variable; otherwise, wait for an operator and perform an operation on the two stores
```
